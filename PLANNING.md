# DrawRef
This is a webapp that holds and presents images, for drawing reference. I'm building this app to learn how new backend and front-end technologies work.

Here's where we'll be doing the planning and all.

## Basics

- **Audience:** Artists are the main users of this app.
  - **Tech-saviness:** Users won't be tech-savvy, keep it simple.
  - **Time spent on the app:** For every couple minutes on the selection side, maybe fourty minutes on the image presentation side.
  - **Environment:** The app likely won't be their main focus. They'll use it as a companion while drawing, off to the side. Could be on a mobile or desktop device.
- **Use:** Click on a category, and see images from that category presented in a format similar to a life-drawing session.
- **Technology:**
  - **Frontend:** React. Maybe TailwindCSS.
  - **Backend:** Express.js.
  - **Login:** SSO with various services.
